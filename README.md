Port of an old KC85-game for Gamebuino Meta

Goal is to collect as many diamonds as needed (see status bar) to unlock the exit.
You can move rocks, if there is nothing behind it. If a rock falls through a changer, then its converted to a diamond.
There are different types of monsters - watch them, to recognise there behaviour. (esp. changing their direction)
Theres a little ingame-menu where you can change the gamemode:
-easy: every killed monster gives some diamonds, this makes some level much easier
-hard: no more diamonds :)
samegames stores hard and easy separatly. Lives counts for both modes.
Each save costs a life.

Included are the levels of the original version, as the author allowed me to use them.
