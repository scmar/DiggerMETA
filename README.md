# DiggerMETA
Port of an old KC85-game for Gamebuino Meta
<br/>

Goal is to collect as many diamonds as needed (see status bar) to unlock the exit.<br/>
You can move rocks, if there is nothing behind it. If a rock falls through a changer, then its converted to a diamond.<br/>
There are different types of monsters - watch them, to recognise there behaviour. (esp. changing their direction)<br/>
Theres a little ingame-menu where you can change the gamemode:<br/>
-easy: every killed monster gives some diamonds, this makes some level much easier<br/>
-hard: no more diamonds :)<br/>
savegames stores hard and easy separatly. Lives counts for both modes.<br/>
Each save costs a life.<br/>
<br/>
Included are the levels of the original version, as the author allowed me to use them.<br/>
